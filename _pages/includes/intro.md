I am currently an assistant professor at the School of Artificial Intelligence <img src='./images/SAI.png' style='width: 2em;'> at Beihang University <img src='./images/buaa.png' style='width: 2em;'> in China.

I graduated from [Department of Automation](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/index.htm), Beijing Institute of Technology (北京理工大学自动化学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/), Beihang University (北京航空航天大学计算机学院) with a Ph.D. degree, advised by Professor [Bo Li (李波)](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/5211.htm). I have been the Research Intership in the Qwen Team of [DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group](https://damo.alibaba.com/). To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, I am honored to serve as the Publicity Chair for the [2nd MLNLP Conference](https://mlnlp.org/mlnlp2023/) in 2023.

My research interests lie within the Knowledge Graph, Computer Vision, and Large Language Model. I have published 20+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ibL7gEcAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fngl567%2Fngl567.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as ACL, CVPR, AAAI, EMNLP and COLING.

I am committed to exploring joint data and knowledge-driven artificial intelligence techniques. I am currently leading various projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) project titled "Commonsense-Guided Trustworthy Knowledge Graph Reasoning Approach", as well as research-industry collaboration projects on "Cross-Temporal and Spatial Target Association in Complex Scenarios". I also lead a project of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph Construction and its Application for Healthy Eating [CookBook-KG ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ngl567/CookBook-KG?style=social)](https://github.com/ngl567/CookBook-KG).

I founded the WeChat public Platform Artificial Intelligence Meets Knowledge Graph (人工智能遇上知识图谱) with 3,000+ followers, where I share advanced technologies in the field of artificial intelligence especially knowledge graph.

Our group has positions for self-motivated PhD students, Master students, and visiting students, please feel free to email me at [beihangngl@buaa.edu.cn](mailto:beihangngl@buaa.edu.cn).
